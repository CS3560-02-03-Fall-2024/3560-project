/**
 *  This is where our api routes will go. For example:
 *
 * /api/hello-world/route.ts
 * export async function GET(request){ ... } serves a GET request at localhost:3000/api/hello-world
 *
 * The same can be done with POST, PUT, DELETE, etc
 * See the next.js docs for how to access the body and query params of a POST, PUT or DELETE request to achieve things like:
 *
 * GET api/hello-world?limit=20
 * POST api/hello-world {body: { message: "hellow-world" }}
 *
 * These are where we will use the client to access and manipulate data withn the database.
