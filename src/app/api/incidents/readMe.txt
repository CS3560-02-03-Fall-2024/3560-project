this file is meant to be a more thurough version of the get/post I had earlier
it is not a finished draft, more like a proposal of functionality
edit details later, for now confirm this is a solid idea for implementation 

most expected edits are noted in comments


note that db.ts should be found somewhere else, but I don't remember where. this version is a proof of concept
db.js and index.js are left over from a previous attempt, not going to delete just yet in case it is still useful but not intending to use


Also, I added jest and its dependencies to test my code, it seems to work
to run test file:
npx jest /src/app/api/incidents/routes.test.ts
